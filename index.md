### Instructions

LEBA captures light exposure-related behaviours on a 5 point Likert type scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = never; 2 = rarely; 3 = sometimes; 4 = often; 5 = always). The score of each factor is calculated by the summation of scores of items belonging to the corresponding factor. Respondends are requested to respond to each item in a retrospective manner where they try to capture their propensity of different light exposure related behaviors in the **past 4 weeks.**
